## Description
The offline access feature in the to-do list app allows users to view, add, and manage their tasks without needing an active internet connection. Users can access their task lists, make updates, and check off completed tasks while offline. Any changes made during offline periods are automatically synchronized with the server once an internet connection is restored.
