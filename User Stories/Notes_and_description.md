## Description
The notes and description feature in the to-do list app allows users to add detailed information to each task, providing context and additional details to aid in task execution. Users can enter a brief description to outline the task's objectives or requirements and attach notes for supplementary information, reminders, or specific instructions. This feature ensures that users have all necessary details at their fingertips, improving task clarity and helping them execute tasks more effectively.
