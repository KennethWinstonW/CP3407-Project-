## Description
The reminders feature in the to-do list app helps users stay on track by providing timely notifications for upcoming tasks and deadlines. Users can set custom reminders for individual tasks, specifying the date and time they want to be alerted. The app sends notifications through various channels, such as push notifications or email, to ensure users are promptly reminded of their scheduled tasks. This feature helps users manage their time effectively, reduce the risk of forgetting important deadlines, and maintain a consistent workflow by keeping them informed about their pending responsibilities.
